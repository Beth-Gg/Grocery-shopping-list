- This provides an overview of the users and their associated information.

### 2. Delete User Accounts

- Exercise caution when deleting user accounts as this action is irreversible.

### 3. Edit User Accounts

Please note that these privileges are exclusively granted to administrators to ensure proper user account management.

We recommend using these privileges responsibly and only accessing and modifying user accounts within the scope of your administrative duties.
